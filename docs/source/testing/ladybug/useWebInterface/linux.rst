This sub-subsection explains how to do a HTTP call to
the electronic archive introduced in :ref:`introduction`
outside the Frank!Framework. This subsection gives the
instructions Linux users need to follow.

Please do the following:

#. Open the Frank!Framework by browsing to http://localhost.
#. Open Ladybug by clicking "Testing" and then clicking "Ladybug":

#. Open a command prompt.
#. Enter the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      curl -i -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/xml" -d '<document>This is the document</document>' localhost/api/archive

#. The result will be something like this: ::

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
     Last-Modified: Thu, 21 Nov 2019 10:29:55 GMT
     Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0, post-check=0, pre-check=0
     Pragma: no-cache
     Allow: OPTIONS, POST
     Content-Type: */*;charset=UTF-8
     Content-Length: 26
     Date: Thu, 21 Nov 2019 10:29:55 GMT

     <docid>docid-12345</docid>

#. Switch back to Ladybug and press Refresh:

#. You see a table in which your HTTP call appears (number 1):

   .. image:: ladybugReport.jpg

#. Click the line corresponding to your call to the electronic archive. You see a tree view of the execution of this Frank adapter (number 2). To the right, you see information about the selected node (number 3). In this case, it is the XML message you passed through the body of your HTTP request.

.. NOTE::

   In the tree view you see the abbreviation SUT. This stands for System Under Test.

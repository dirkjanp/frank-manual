Preparations
============

In this sub-subsection of :ref:`ignore`, we set the stage for examining this functionality. You will learn nothing new. If you are not following the instructions but are just reading, you can skip this sub-subsection.

Please do the following:

.. highlight:: none

#. Stop the Frank!Framework.
#. Edit :code:`configurations/ladybug/Configuration.xml` as shown by the highlighted line:

   .. include:: ../../../snippets/ladybugInstance/v520/referenceExternalTime.txt

#. Restart the Frank!Framework.
#. Open Ladybug by clicking "Testing" and then "Ladybug" as shown below:

   .. image:: ../../frankConsoleFindTestTools.jpg

#. We delete all existing tests because they are no longer relevant. Click tab "Test" (number 1 in the picture below). Select the top node in the tree view (number 2). Press "Select all" (number 3) to select all tests (number 4). Then press "Delete" (number 5).

#. A confirmation dialog appears, proceed. Press "Refresh" (number 6). All test reports should be gone.
#. Go to "Test Pipeline". To the top, you see you are indeed in the Test Pipeline screen (number 1 in the picture below). Select adapter "sutGet" (number 2). In the message field (number 3), enter the following XML: :code:`<docid>docid-12345</docid>`. Then press "Send" (number 4). You see that execution was successful (number 5) and you see a result (number 6).

   .. image:: sutGetTestPipeline.jpg

#. The result should be:

   .. code-block:: XML

      <result>
          <document>
              This is the document
          </document>
          <retrievalTime>
              2019-11-26T10:57:37UTC
          </retrievalTime>
      </result>

   You see that the current time is part of the result. This will be different each time the "sutGet" adapter is run.
#. Go back to Ladybug. Click tab "Debug" (number 1 in the picture below). Click "Refresh" (number 2). Select the topmost row with a report about running "sutGet" (number 3). Select the topmost "Pipeline" node in the tree view (number 4). Select stub strategy "Never" (number 5). Then press "Copy" (number 6).
